## Benchmark meta-config for `eval_compare.py`
##
## Notes:
## - This config does NOT change any environment YAMLs under `cfg/`.
## - It only drives how `eval_compare.py` samples (env, role->alg variants) and runs them.
## - "roles" correspond to EconGym roles:
##   - households, market, bank
##   - government sub-roles: tax | pension | central_bank (depending on env)


environments_to_benchmark:
  - estate_tax
  - inflation_control
  - optimal_monetary
  - optimal_tax
  - work_life_well_being
  - pension_gap
